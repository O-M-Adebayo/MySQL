/*

This SQL code computes advanced summary statistics such as population variance and
quartiles. It also generates frequency distributions with percentages, identifies
outliers using the interquartile range method, and visualizes data using histograms.
Additionally, it computes correlations between variables using the Pearson correlation
coefficient.
